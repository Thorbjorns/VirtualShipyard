# VirtualShipyard - (STATUS, NOT FINISHED) I'm creating here some fun project to learn more about java structures and how to operate on them.
Here I want to create some kind of manager of shipyard company. Actions which I want to create in this program are 
(adding/removing/showing workers, insert and showing logs of accidents, task managment, and more :) )
